## Project Title
# **helpd**

## Project Description
This project is an android application that aims at ensuring that the domestic workers in India have a safe and regular-salaried job. The
app also solves the problem of not being able to find reliable domestic help for people in need. 

### Language Requirements
- Java
- XML

### Prerequisites
- Install JDK, Java, and Git (Github) on development machine
- Install Android Studio development environment
- Android device (for testing purposes)

## Modules Working on Currently  
- The MainActivity.java accepts user preferences and timings which are written into the database. 
- Available.java retreives information of all the helpers from the database and shows the helper whose services and timings match with 
the user's.

## Modules to be Worked On
1. Users can change or add on to their preferences.
2. Include the feature Instant Help that will be let users hire help on an hourly basis according to their need. 
3. Include ratings: the user can rate the services of the helper and the helper/organisation shall rate the user.
4. User will be able to see the history of the times he/she has hired help.

## Future Plans
1. We plan on increasing the security from both the user and domestic helper sides. 
2. We also plan on aggregating other small businesses like plumbing or gardening.
